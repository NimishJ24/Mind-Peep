        In today's world, the biggest issue a student faces is a lack of concentration due to the large number of
        distractions available at the ready to them.<br />
        Each person is unique and ways to deal with their respective problems should
        be the same.Our idea is to basically try and solve this issue faced by most of the students
        through the concept of "personality types" which is somewhat a measure of a person's uniqueness.<br /></p></td>
